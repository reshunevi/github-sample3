    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h1>
    <p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are two different versions of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol that governs how data is transmitted over the internet. Here are some key differences between the two:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Multiplexing: HTTP/2 supports multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be sent and received at the same time over a single connection. In contrast, HTTP/1.1 only allows one request/response at a time, which can slow down the loading of web pages that require multiple requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            Binary vs. Text Protocol: HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, whereas HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol. The binary format of HTTP/2 allows for more efficient encoding and decoding of data, which can lead to faster transmission of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Server Push: HTTP/2 supports server push, which allows servers to send resources to clients before the client requests them. This can help to improve the performance of web pages by reducing the number of requests needed to load a page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Header Compression: HTTP/2 uses header compression to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. This can help to improve performance and reduce latency.
        </li>
        <li>
            TLS Encryption: While TLS encryption was optional in HTTP/1.1, it is mandatory in HTTP/2. This helps to improve security by encrypting all data transmitted between the client and server.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, HTTP/2 offers several improvements over HTTP/1.1 in terms of performance, security, and efficiency. However, it is important to note that not all servers and clients support HTTP/2 yet, and it may require some additional configuration to work properly.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Objects and its internal representation in Javascript</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair. Objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or the <b>class</b> syntax introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
    <p>Internally, objects in JavaScript are implemented as a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any type of value, including other objects or functions. Object properties can be accessed using dot notation <b>(object.property)</b> or bracket notation <b>(object['property'])</b>.</p>
    <p>JavaScript uses a process called "boxing" to represent primitive values (such as strings or numbers) as objects when needed. This allows primitive values to be treated as objects and accessed using object properties and methods.</p>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript are mutable, meaning that their properties can be changed or added at any time. Objects can also be passed as arguments to functions or returned as values from functions.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that JavaScript objects are dynamic and don't have a fixed set of properties. This means that you can add or remove properties from an object at any time, which can be both powerful and potentially dangerous. It's also important to be aware of the difference between assigning objects by reference and by value, as this can affect how changes to an object are propagated throughout your code.</p>
