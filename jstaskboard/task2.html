    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Difference between window Object and Document</h1>
    <p>In web development, both the <b>'window'</b> object and the <b>'document'</b> object are part of the client-side JavaScript environment and are used extensively when working with the DOM (Document Object Model). However, they have different purposes and functions.</p>
    <p>The <b>'window'</b> object represents the browser window or tab that contains the DOM document. It is the top-level object in the client-side JavaScript environment and provides access to the browser's location, history, and other properties. The window object also contains methods for controlling the window, such as resizing, scrolling, and opening new windows or tabs.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the <b>'document'</b> object represents the current web page or HTML document displayed in the browser window or tab. It provides access to the elements in the document, such as the HTML elements, text nodes, and attributes. The document object is used to manipulate the content and structure of the web page, including adding or deleting elements, modifying attributes, or changing the CSS styles.</p>
    <p>In summary, the <b>"window"</b> object represents the browser window or tab, while the <b>'document'</b> object represents the current HTML document displayed in that window or tab. While the two objects are closely related and interact with each other, they have different functions and properties.</p>
